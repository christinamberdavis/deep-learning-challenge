## **Background:**
This project was created as part of a data anlaytics bootcamp. The goal is to use Python and deep learning to build a neural network model that can predict which venturs who apply for funding will be successful. 

Relevant Files:
- [Starter Code Jupyter Notebook](Deep\ Learning\ Challenge/Starter_Code.ipynb)
    -This contains the original neural network model.
- [AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization Jupyter Notebook](Deep Learning Challenge/AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb.ipynb)
    -This contains 4 attempts to optimize the neural network to see if accuracy can be improved. 
- [Outputs](Deep Learning Challenge/Output)
    -Contains h5 files of the models and weights taken during training
-[Analysis of the models][Deep Learning Challenge/Analysis.md]
- Resources
  - [charity_data.csv](Resources/charity_data.csv)
  -This data was provided as part of the exercise. 


## **Part 1: Creating Original Model in Start Code Notebook**
This contains the code for data processing and set up of the initial neural network. Results are included. This is a good place to start if you want code for 1 neural network. 

See [Starter Code Jupyter Notebook](Deep Learning Challenge/Starter_Code.ipynb)


## **Part 2: Optimizing the model**
I ran through 4 variations of data preprocessing and model parameters to try and improve on the original model. This can be found in [AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization Jupyter Notebook](Deep Learning Challenge/AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb.ipynb).


## How to Run the App
1. Clone the repo to your computer.
   - [How to Clone Github Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

2. Open the deep-learning-challnge folder in VS Code on your personal computer or upload to your Google drive to run in Google Colabs. Note that you will need to give permission to access the drive files in your Colabs notebook.

3. Navigate to the [Starter Code Jupyter Notebook](Deep Learning Challenge/Starter_Code.ipynb) file in the folder.

4. Connect to your kernal. 

5. Run all cells.
