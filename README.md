- - -

## **Background:**
This project was created as part of a data anlaytics bootcamp. The goal is to use Python and deep learning to build a neural network model that can predict which venturs who apply for funding will be successful. 

Relevant Files:
- [Credit Risk Classification Jupyter Notebook](Credit_Risk/credit_risk_classification.ipynb)
    -The data analysis is completed in this notebook.
- Resources
  - [lending_data.csv](Resources/lending_data.csv)
  -This data was provided as part of the exercise. 


## **Part 1: Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets**


## **Part 3: Create a Logistic Regression Model with Oversampled Data**
